# Video Chat with Multiple Users

## Introduction

In this tutorial, we will create **Mooyaho Meet**, which is a video chat webapp similar to [Google Meet](https://meet.google.com/). In this app, multiple users can have conversations with each other.

Since there are many UI to prepare, we will use [React](https://reactjs.org/) to build the app to make the development easier.

Furthermore, we also have to implement a simple API server to manage channels and user sessions. We will use [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and [Express](https://expressjs.com/) to build the server.

Source code of this tutorial is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/mooyaho-webrtc)



## Create Mooyaho Meet Server

### Initialize Project

Let's first prepare a server to manage Mooyaho channels and sessions.

Create a project directory and initialize a Node.js project. Then, install express to create a web server.

```bash
$ mkdir mooyaho-meet-server
$ cd mooyaho-meet-server
$ yarn init -y # or npm init -y
$ yarn add express # or npm install express
```

### Enable ESM in Node.js 

We have to enable [ESM](https://nodejs.org/docs/latest-v14.x/api/esm.html) module system in our project because one of our dependency of the sample project (lowdb) is only compatible with ESM. 

> Mooyaho itself is compatible with both CommonJS and ESM. `lowdb` is only used in this sample project.

Add `"type": "module"` to `package.json` file. 

Now, ESM is enabled in our project. You can use `import` instead of `require` to import modules.

After installation, create `main.js` file in your project directory, and enter the following code.

```js
import express from 'express'

const app = express()

app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.send('Hello World')
})

app.listen(5000, () => {
  console.log('Server is running on port 5000')
})
```

Then, enter the following command to start the server.

```bash
node ./main.js
```

Check [http://localhost:5000/](http://localhost:5000/) from your browser to see your server is running.

In this server project, we will create 3 API endpoints.

**`main.js`**

```js {5-13}
const express = require('express')

const app = express()

app.get('/auth/integrate', (req, res) => {
  // integrates user session information
})
app.post('/meet', (req, res) => {
  // creates meet channel
})
app.get('/meet/:code', (req, res) => {
  // retrieve meet channel information
})

app.listen(5000, () => {
  console.log('Server is running on port 5000')
})
```

### Initialize Mooyaho Engine

In this section, we will initialize Mooyaho Engine, and integrate our server to it.

To initialize mooyaho engine, enter following command from outside of current server project directory.

```bash
npx mooyaho-cli init engine
```

After initializing, run the Mooyaho Engine.

```bash
cd mooyaho-engine
yarn start
```

### Connect to Mooyaho Engine from Server

Now, we will create a Mooyaho client instance from our API server. By using this client instance, you can manage the channels and sessions via its methods. To do this, install `@mooyaho/server-sdk` from the server.

<Tabs
  defaultValue="yarn"
  values={[
    { label: 'Yarn', value: 'yarn' },
    { label: 'npm', value: 'npm' },
  ]}
>
<TabItem value="yarn">

```bash
yarn add @mooyaho/server-sdk
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="npm">

```bash
npm install @mooyaho/server-sdk
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

Then, import the package and create the instance as following.

```js {1,5-8}
import Mooyaho from 'mooyaho';
const express = require('express')

const app = express()
const mooyaho = new Mooyaho('
  http://localhost:8080',
  '******'
)

app.get('/auth/integrate', (req, res) => {
  // integrates user session information
})
app.post('/meet', (req, res) => {
  // creates meet channel
})
app.get('/meet/:code', (req, res) => {
  // retrieve meet channel information
})

app.listen(5000, () => {
  console.log('Server is running on port 5000')
})
```

The second parameter of `Mooyaho` class is the API Server secret key. To retrieve the secret key, check `API_KEY` field of the `.env` file from the Mooyaho Engine directory. This key is generated automatically when you have initialized your Mooyaho Engine.


### Setup database

We need a database to store channel information. For the database, we will use lowdb which is lightweight embedded database. In real project, you should use a database like MongoDB or MariaDB since this database is only suitable for small projects.

Install lowdb to your project.

<Tabs
  defaultValue="yarn"
  values={[
    { label: 'Yarn', value: 'yarn' },
    { label: 'npm', value: 'npm' },
  ]}
>
<TabItem value="yarn">

```bash
yarn add lowdb
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="npm">

```bash
npm install lowdb
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

Next, create db.js file in your server project directory and write the code as below.

```js
import { Low, JSONFile } from 'lowdb'
import path from 'path'
import { fileURLToPath } from 'url'

const __dirname = path.dirname(fileURLToPath(import.meta.url)) // way to retrieve __dirname in ESM
const file = path.resolve(__dirname, './db.json')
const adapater = new JSONFile(file)
const db = new Low(adapater)

export default db
```

We've separated the database setup code to another file to make the server code simple possible.

Now, we are ready to implement the Server API.
